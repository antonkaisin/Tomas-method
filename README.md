## Tridiagonal matrix algorithm (Thomas algorithm)
The initial system of linear equations has the form:

$$ c_{i}x_{i-1} + d_{i}*x{i} + e_{i}*x{i+1} = f_{i} $$, where i=2,...,n-1 

* Source files: input1,inpu2,input3
* Files result: result1, result2, result3

1. To skip the program, you need to write `make`
2. And then write `./main`
